## 🧑‍💻 Task Overview

This project is a part of the interview process for the **MERN Intern** position at **Metalogic Software Pvt. Ltd.** The task was to select a page from [Metalogic’s official website](https://www.metalogic.com.np), redesign it using modern UI/UX practices, and implement it using the specified tech stack.

## 🎯 Why I Chose the “About Us” Page

While reviewing the website, I found that:

- The **hero section** of the "About Us" page was too simplistic and lacked a visual hierarchy or engaging elements.
- The **"Distributed Team"** section was unclear — it didn't effectively communicate information about the team members or the global aspect of Metalogic's workforce.

To address this, I redesigned the page with the following goals in mind:

- Introduce a **visually appealing and informative hero section** with engaging copy and call-to-action.
- Clearly showcase the **Distributed Team** section with team member profiles, descriptions, and region tags to reflect a global presence.
